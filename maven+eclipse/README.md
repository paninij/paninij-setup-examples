# `ex-paninij-maven-eclipse-setup`

The contents of this folder demonstrate how to configure a simple @PaniniJ
project which can be built with Maven and developed within Eclipse.

Integration depends upon two Eclipse plugins:

- [`m2e`](https://eclipse.org/m2e/)
- [`m2e-apt`](https://marketplace.eclipse.org/content/m2e-apt).

If both of these Eclipse plugins are installed, then you should be able to just
import this project. Specifically,

- Select "File" > "Import" > "Maven" > "Existing Maven Projects"
- Select this directory as the "Root Directory"
- Click "Finish"
