# `ex-paninij-maven-intellij-setup`

From the command line, we can compile this project with `mvn compile` and we
can run it with `mvn exec:java`.

We can also import this Maven project into IntelliJ IDEA. Once imported, we can
build the project via "Build" > "Build Project" and we can run it in the normal
way.

Note that the project isn't fully built via IntelliJ's incremental compilation.
This is because IntelliJ won't automatically run the @PaniniJ annotation
processor.

This is because it appears that there isn't a good way to make IntelliJ IDEA
to be able to use Maven's configuration and to incrementally compile a project
using annotation processors.

So, the solution which we use here is to have all annotation processing driven
by Maven, even while within IntelliJ.

This means that we need to manually run "Build Project" before we can see any
@PaniniJ errors compile errors and generated sources.

Note the use of the `build-helper-maven-plugin` in the `pom.xml` file. This
configuration is needed to help IntelliJ find the sources generated by the
annotation processor. Without this, IntelliJ will just ignore the contents of
the `target/generated-sources/` directory, just like the other contents of
`target/`.
