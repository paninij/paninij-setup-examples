# `ex-paninij-maven-setup`

Compile the project using `mvn compile`, and run the executable with
`mvn exec:java`.

Nothing is required to enable the @PaniniJ compiler plugin. It is enough to
just add it as a regular Maven dependency. (See the `dependencies` section at
the bottom of this project's `pom.xml` file.)

Notice that the sources generated by the compiler plugin are placed in
`target/generated-source/java`.
